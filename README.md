This is the first game I've ever publicly released on Google Play(No longer active)
Though I am proud of the game I've made there are many thinkg I'd do differently were I to do it now:

-Make the SHOP easier to read
-Add MUISC to enhance the atmosphere
-Make the player sprite REACT more to movement
-Add POWER UPS to the game loop
-Make it so you cannot go OUT OF BOUNDS
-DIFFICULTY scaling
-Optimize the GRAPHICS
-server side SAVING instead of client side
-ENEMIES variaty
-slicker UI
